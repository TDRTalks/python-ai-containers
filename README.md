# Containers, AI, and Awesome Music

Have you ever wanted to understand who are the best and worst bands of an era? Join us on this journey as we build a cloud app using some of the best AI and appdev tools built by Microsoft. We'll cover topics ranging from gathering and cleaning data to containerizing and running apps in the Cloud. We'll write code using Python, use containers in Azure, Azure Functions, Cosmos DB and Microsoft Cognitive Services and discover who's the most sappy band of the 80s.
